Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to get started using our dataset is with the REST API.  Each dataset has a set of standard endpoints that can be used to query or steam data.  For this example, we will use the *Total Energy Data and Statistics* metadata from https://data.gov.

- **/api** -- Description of the API and available datasets. 
- **/api/energy** -- Energy dataset metadata descriptions
- **/api/energy/
